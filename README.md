# Practical6 


## Google Colab
In [this practical](https://github.com/KF5012-AI2020/Practical6) you will use jupyter notebooks within Google Colab and learn how to use GPUs for deep learning.

Open up [GoogleColab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and import the notebooks in this repository to get started. You can do this by clicking File -> Open Notebook -> Github and search for KF5012-AI2020.

Also, this is a great chance to ask questions about your project proposals that will be due this Friday. 


## What is in this Practical Session
1. Image Classification Recap
2. Python Classes
3. Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Prediction

It is suggested to read the notebooks in the above order.
