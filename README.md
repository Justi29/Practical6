# Practical6 


## Google Colab
In [this practical](https://github.com/KF5012-AI2020/Practical6) you will use jupyter notebooks within Google Colab and learn how to use GPUs for deep learning.

Also, this is a great chance to ask questions about your project proposals that will be due this Friday. 


## What is in this Practical Session
1. Image Classification Recap
2. Python Classes
3. Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series Prediction
4. (Optional) Project-related Experimentation

It is suggested to read the notebooks in the above order. 

## Google Colab
Open up [GoogleColab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and import the notebooks in this repository to get started.
